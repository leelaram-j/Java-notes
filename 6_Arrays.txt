Heap:

heap is the place where java variables are stored.

JVM gets storage from OS 

Data Structures basic:

Array


array is a container object that holds fixed values of single type


3 ways to create an array

1) int[] myArray= new int[7];

2) int [] myArray = new int[]{1,2,3,4,5};

3) int[] myArray = {1,2,3,4,5};


length of an array

myArray.length;

array of object references can alos be created.

Students stud = new Students[2];

stud[0] = new Students();
stud[1] = new Students();


Linear layout in storage-> fast random access

not suited for fast searching, as it searches in a linear pattern and using it will delay the process.

array index out of bounds exception will occur if an element outside the array boundary is accessed. For eg. accessing 8th element when the array has only 7 elements.
