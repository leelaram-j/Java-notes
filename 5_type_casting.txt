Type Casting:

Assigning variable of one type to another

only numeric-numeric is possible.

boolean to any type or vice versa not possible

Implicit casting 
explicit casting


Implicit:
smaller to larger

eg byte to int

byte->short->int->long->float->double

char->int

this is done by compiler itself

char is internally represented by unsigned integer


explicit casting:

vice versa of above..


larger to smaller

note that the casting type should be less than the one that is already available

eg long y=43;
int x = (int) y;
